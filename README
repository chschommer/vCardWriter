VCardWriter can "translate" a LDIF File  to a vCard

Export it as a .jar file and run it in a terminal.
You can also use VCardWriter.jar

Options:

VCardWriter[Type. LDIF or N] [input-File] [output-File-Name]


N-Type is a simple Type for Contacts. An Example:

Name: Doe
GivenName: John
Mail: JohnDoe@blub.org

Notes:
- If you're a german user, you can also use "Vorname:" instead of "GivenName:".
- Only tested with LDIF Files created by Mozilla Thunderbird
- Output File will be named to ~.vcf automatically
