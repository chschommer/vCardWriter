VCardWriter can "translate" a LDIF File  to to  vCard

Export it as a .jar file and run it in a terminal.

Options:

CSVWRiter [Type. LDIF or N] [input-File] [output-File-Name]


N-Type is a simple Type for Contacts. An Example:

Name: Doe
GivenName: John
Mail: JohnDoe@blub.org

Note:
If you're a german user, you can also use "Vorname:" instead of "GivenName".
